#Abstract
AUV is a robot that travels underwater without requiring input from an operator.  UUV's missions: Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, Mine countermeasures, Anti-submarine warfare, Inspection/identification, Oceanography, Communication/navigation network nodes, Payload delivery, Information operations, Time-critical strikes

#Methodology
AUV is a robot that travels underwater without requiring input from an operator.  UUV's missions: Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, Mine countermeasures, Anti-submarine warfare, Inspection/identification, Since radio waves do not propagate well under water, many AUV's incorporate Acoustic Modems to enable remote command and control.AUVs carry sensors to navigate autonomously and map features of the ocean. Typical sensors include compasses, depth sensors, sidescan and other sonars
